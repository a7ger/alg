# alg

This is mostly for me to practice C++. Nothing more. Not intended for any other purpose!

Only tested in Ubuntu 18.04

build with `make` in "build" directory

run with `./alg [file.alg]`

alg will interpret your source file "file.alg" and execute it's code.

example:

![example](./images/example.png)


## Available Functions for alg files:

#### void print("string literal goes here");
  
prints string literal to stdout
